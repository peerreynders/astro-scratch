# Lesson 19

Just followed [Sass and SCSS](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#sass-and-scss) i.e.:

```shell
npm i sass
```

Created a `src/styles/styles.scss` file to hold the styles and then…

```Astro
---
// file: src/layouts/Base.astro
// …

import '../styles/styles.scss';
```

and Astro takes care of the rest.

Filled in the styling as I went along; more about that in [lesson 22](../../README.md#lesson-22).
